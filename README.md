# Pantry Pilot 

Pantry Pilot is an intelligent recipe application designed to help you discover what you can cook with the ingredients you already have. By leveraging the power of OpenAI, this app takes your list of on-hand ingredients and generates creative and delicious recipes, complete with cooking instructions. It also tracks your most-used ingredients to provide personalized recipe recommendations over time.

This project is built as a full-stack application featuring a React frontend and a secure serverless backend hosted on Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user signup and login using email/password and Google Sign-In.
* **AI-Powered Recipe Generation:** Enter a list of ingredients and receive a complete recipe generated by OpenAI's GPT model.
* **Ingredient Frequency Tracking:** The app automatically learns your most-used ingredients to understand your cooking style.
* **Personalized "Explore" Page:** Get a curated list of new recipe recommendations based on the ingredients you use most often.
* **Save Recipes:** Users can save their favorite generated recipes to their profile.
* **User Profile:** A dedicated page to view saved recipes and see personal stats, such as "Member Since" and "Recipes Saved".
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** The project is configured with a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, building, and deployment to Firebase.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Material-UI
* **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database, Cloud Functions) & **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
* **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT-3.5 Turbo)
* **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting & GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and the Firebase CLI installed on your machine.

* Install Node.js: <https://nodejs.org/>
* Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pantry-pilot.git
cd pantry-pilot
```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
npm install


3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
cd functions
npm install
cd ..


4. **Create a Firebase & Google Cloud Project**
* Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
* **Note:** Every Firebase project is also a full Google Cloud (GCP) project. You may need to access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for advanced settings.
* In Firebase, enable **Authentication** (with Email/Password and Google providers).
* In Firebase, enable **Firestore Database**.
* Upgrade your project to the **Blaze (Pay-as-you-go) plan**. This is required for v2 Cloud Functions.

5. **Configure Frontend Environment Variables**
* In the Firebase Console, go to your Project Settings and add a new **Web App**.
* Firebase will give you a `firebaseConfig` object.
* At the root of your project, create a file named `.env.local`.
* Copy your keys into the file like this:
  ```
  VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-key
  VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
  VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
  VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
  VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
  ```

6. **Configure Backend API Key**
* Get your API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
* In your terminal (at the project root), run the following command to securely set the secret. Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with your actual key.
  ```
  firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY
  ```
* When prompted, paste your key and confirm.

7. **Run the Application Locally**
* **Terminal 1:** Start the Firebase Emulators for local testing.
  ```
  firebase emulators:start --only auth,functions,firestore
  ```
* **Terminal 2:** Start the React development server.
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```
* Open the localhost link in your browser to view the app.
